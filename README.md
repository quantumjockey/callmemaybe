# Callmemaybe

This is an attempt at a gem that allows the user to invoke WCF services from within a Ruby application back-end. I'm relatively new to Ruby and figured this would be good way to connect my learning so far with Microsoft's technology lineup, a collection of things I've been working with for years. Here goes nothing!
